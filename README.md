# WT-langmod
Warthunder's default naming scheme has it's flaws. For this reason, I've decided to create my own custom localization. 

This mod aimes to provide a consistent, detailed and accurate naming convention for vehicle names.
I might still play around with vehicle names, but the vehicle names are done.
